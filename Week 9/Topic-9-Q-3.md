I have a tough time discerning the difference between the Vue version and HTML, due to both accessing Vue functionality via the same method. I had an easier time with the HTML version, most likely because we went through it in class. The Vue version had some stipulations that made the creation process harder. I couldn't figure out how to make the webpage buttons work with the on:call method, no matter how much I tried. In the end, I had to change on:call to on:click in order to make the webpage function as intended even if it wasn't the way the lab wanted.  


If I'm being honest, I don't know how the Vue application in the student-roster-html page differs from the Vue version. It looks the same to me. It probably doesn't help that the top of the code still claims that the code is HTML. I admittedly feel bad about my inability to tell the difference.  It feels like a big portion of topic 9 went over my head. Fortunately, that seems to be the only part of topic 9 that I didn't fully understand. Outside of that, I learned a lot about Vue and more advanced coding techniques. => method is convenient; I was wondering if you know any other coding languages that use a method like =>?
